# PyPassword Generator
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
This Python script generates a strong and secure password based on user-defined criteria for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers. The password is randomly shuffled to ensure randomness and security.

# Features
Customizable length for letters, symbols, and numbers.
Randomized order of characters for enhanced security.
Simple and user-friendly command-line interface.

#How It Works
>The user specifies how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.
>The script generates random characters from the specified categories.
>All characters are then shuffled to ensure the password is randomized.
>The final password is displayed to the user.
